LinqToWiki.ManuallyGenerated
============================

This project shows how you could manually write your own
configuration assembly for use with LINQ to Wiki.
Doing that can be useful if you want to acess results of some of the more complicated modules
that aren't handled well by code generated by LinqToWiki.Codegen.
For example the code in [`LinqToWiki.Codegen.ModuleInfo`](https://github.com/svick/LINQ-to-Wiki/tree/master/LinqToWiki.Codegen/ModuleInfo)
does something very similar.

In such a case, it might make sense to start with C# code generated by LinqToWiki.Codegen
and modify it the way you need.
To do that, you have to use LinqToWiki.Codegen directly, LinqToWiki.Codegen.App won't help you with that.
