\section{Samples of queries}
\label{ltw-s}

The project LinqToWiki.Samples contains one class with methods
that show the usage of each available module of the \ac{API}.
It also contains one real-world complex query that combines LinqToWiki with LINQ to Objects
to search for empty categories that are not redirects.

When run, it is a console application that shows the output of the selected module.
Selecting the module to use is done by changing which method is called by the \lstinline{Main()} method.
