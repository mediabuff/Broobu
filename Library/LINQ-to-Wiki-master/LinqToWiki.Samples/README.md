LinqToWiki.Samples
==================

This project includes samples that show the usage of most of the methods available in LINQ to Wiki.
All samples are in [Program.cs](https://github.com/svick/LINQ-to-Wiki/blob/master/LinqToWiki.Samples/Program.cs).

The file is split into `#region`s which describe what each set of method shows.
The page source methods also show composability of that part of LINQ to Wiki:
creating a page source and querying that page source can be separate,
so if you want to query one source in different ways
or query multiple different sources in the same way,
you can avoid repeating yourself.
